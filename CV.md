**That Other Job You Had**

Also with a short description.

Technical Experience
--------------------

My Cool Side Project
:   For items which don't have a clear time ordering, a definition
    list can be used to have named items.

    * These items can also contain lists, but you need to mind the
      indentation levels in the markdown source.
    * Second item.

Open Source
:   List open source contributions here, perhaps placing emphasis on
    the project names, for example the **Linux Kernel**, where you
    implemented multithreading over a long weekend, or **node.js**
    (with [link](http://nodejs.org)) which was actually totally
    your idea...

Programming Languages
:   **first-lang:** Here, we have an itemization, where we only want
    to add descriptions to the first few items, but still want to
    mention some others together at the end. A format that works well
    here is a description list where the first few items have their
    first word emphasized, and the last item contains the final few
    emphasized terms. Notice the reasonably nice page break in the pdf
    version, which wouldn't happen if we generated the pdf via html.

:   **second-lang:** Description of your experience with second-lang,
    perhaps again including a [link] [ref], this time placing the url
    reference elsewhere in the document to reduce clutter (see source
    file). 

:   **obscure-but-impressive-lang:** We both know this one's pushing
    it.

:   Basic knowledge of **C**, **x86 assembly**, **forth**, **Common Lisp**

Extra Section, Call it Whatever You Want
----------------------------------------

* Human Languages:

     * English (native speaker)
     * ???
     * This is what a nested list looks like.

* Random tidbit

* Other sort of impressive-sounding thing you did
    - Pineapple
* Gamma (with numbered sublist)
    1. One
    2. Two

### A paragraph spaced one:

Not all stylesheets make these have more spacing.

* Alpha

* Beta

* Gamma

And the spacing after might be too tight.

Ordered lists
-------------

### A simple one:

1. One
2. Two
3. Three

### A nested one:

1. One
    1. Alpha
    2. Beta
2. Two (with unordered sublist)
    * Gamma
    * Delta
3. Three
    1. Apple
        1. Circle
        2. Triangle
            1. North
                1. East
                2. West
            2. South
                * Up
                * Down
        3. Square
    1. Orange


Block Quotes
============

We simply italicize them and don't do any fancy quote bar or decoration 
since they are already indented on the left and right.

> We simply italicize them and don't do any fancy quote bar or decoration 
since they are already indented on the left and right.


Code
====

Code blocks are styled more to be set apart a bit more than just the monospaced 
font. A light background color and border (in case the background doesn't print, 
but it looks nice too).

	x = e * 10 / 2;
	y = p - 7;

On screen, the blocks provide scroll boxes and the `inline code spans` 
word wrap. For print, the code blocks also change to word wrap. On screen, the 
`code spans` also get a little border, but lose it in print.

Links
=====

Remove the underline except on hover. When printing, remove all styling and 
print external URLs after the link text to be useful in a printout. There is no 
filter to not print very long URLs though.

A link to [Google][]. A simple link to <http://wikipedia.org>.

I haven't figured out how to not redundantly print the URL after a simple link 
whose link text is the URL.

[Google]: http://www.google.com

Horizontal rule
===============

A thin line that doesn't have that shadow thing that looks terrible, especially 
in print.

See the end for what footnotes looks like[^1].

[^1]: A double-line rule with the word "NOTES" in the center.

Definition Lists
================

Still may tweak this. Trying to use subtle lines to help group it, but it feels 
a bit too table-like. However, without them, it doesn't seem to stand out much.

Term

:   Definition of the term

Term2

:   First definition of Term2
    It can be a long, wrapped paragraph like this.
    
    A definition can include multiple paragraphs if they are indented
    the same in Pandoc and MultiMarkdown 3. MultiMarkdown 2 doesn't
    support this, so it will be interpreted there as a code block
    following the Term2 definition.
    
    - They can also include Markdown
    - If it supports multiple paragraphs, a definition can contain lists and things
    - But the first has to start as a regular paragraph

Term3

:   A term can have multiple definitions. 

:   The second definition of Term3. Depending on the stylesheet for HTML
    you are using or the output format (LaTeX, etc.), this second
    definition may appear styled as a separate term but without the term
    itself.


Tables
======

These get more styling than most things, yet it's still very little compared to 
most table stylings, but way better than an un-styled HTML table. It's to emulate 
a simple textbook style, but we throw in a hover row highlight to be a little 
useful on-screen when scrubbing around the table.

  Right     Left     Center     Default
-------     ------ ----------   -------
     12     12        12            12
    123     123       123          123
      1     1          1             1
